The intention with this project is to reproduce a potential CTS issue described [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/262750721).

Basically the suspicion is that after an app is updated, the application might not continue to run on some device unless the vendor proprietary "Autostart" option is enabled in Settings. This has been tested mainly on a Xiaomi device for now.
